Age-Calculator-using-JavaScript
To create an age calculator using JavaScript, you can use the Date object to determine the current date and subtract the user's birth date from the current date to calculate their age in years. JavaScript is a programming language commonly used to add interactivity and other dynamic features to websites. In conjunction with HTML and CSS, it is frequently used to develop web pages and applications that can respond to user input, regulate the behavior of page elements, and interact with other web services.

We need the user's input of a date (date of birth), and the output will be the time elapsed between the user's input and the current date. Years, months, and days will use to indicate the determined age. We will develop an HTML form to collect the user's input for the birth date and utilize JavaScript to determine the age. It will accept dynamic user input.
